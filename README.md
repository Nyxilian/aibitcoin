No my works intended.

The goal of this project was to know how to take advatage of AI
by making an AI bitcoin trader.

What I've learned is following:
1. AI and its API
2. Many different APIs, YoutubeTranScriptAPI and SERPAPI
3. SQLite DB
4. Selenium
5. Entry-level knowledge of Json of how it can be utilized

For now, I have no clue on stocks or cryptocurrencies.
If I have more knowledge, I am willingly to edit the codes.
